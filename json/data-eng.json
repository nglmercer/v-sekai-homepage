    "whygodotext": "We felt there was a need for a remixable ecosystem focused on VR. Social VR should be a truly community-driven experience. For this to be realised, we believe the entire software stack should be available, moddable, and tweakable from the source up, which is why we encourage you to tinker with our code on GitHub and a lot of our projects focus on the MIT-Licensed Godot Engine. \n- As such, the license of Godot Engine is compatible with our goals and should allow for fully custom-built solutions at the engine level. Additionally, we're able to make use of the hard work of thousands of Godot contributors to keep the technology stack powering V-Sekai innovative and competitive amongst industry leading engines.\n- âœ… \n- An astute reader might be wondering, why not use a more developed, commercial engine, perhaps even one whose name begins with 'u'? It's a good question, and there are other projects which may go this route. By synergizing with the dozens of core Godot developers and thousands of individual contributors, building upon the rising star Godot Engine 4.0 offers V-Sekai a unique opportunity to create a truly community owned, fully free ecosystem that won't be forever in a corporate shadow. We hope to follow a shining role model, Blender, which has grown over two decades to become an industry leader.",

We have already been tackling many of the technical challenges required to make such a project possible on the Godot game engine, including: \n\n ------------------- \n1. Spatialised audio and VOIP support \n2. Native VRM support \n3. Our own custom networking stack \n4. A security-focused sandboxed scripting environment backed by WASM \n5.
